Andrés is a PhD student at ETH Zurich working at the intersection of Remote Sensing, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Andres joined the EcoVision Lab in 2017 after finishing his master studies in Statistics at ETH Zurich.

Born and raised in Colombia, Andrés developed a broader perception of global challenges like poverty, human rights and deforestation; which is why he actively directs his research towards solving them. His current research uses Machine Learning to process Optical and Radar satellite imagery for large-​scale object and change detection applications.
