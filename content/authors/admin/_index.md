I am a software developer specialized on **satellite image analysis** with **machine learning** models for environmental monitoring. I have several years of experience developing machine learning models with business partners on a project basis. My scientific publications showcase: (1) models that can deal with small and biased training datasets; (2) how to design \textbf{cost-saving labelling schemes} for large datasets, and (3) early use-cases of **generative models**.
After finishing my PhD at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Konrad Schinlder and Prof. Jan D. Wegner, I **co-founded** [Kapok.ai](https://kapok.ai/), a start-up focused on machine learning models for agriculture and ESG sectors.

Born and raised in Colombia, I developed a broader perception of global challenges like sustainable development, biodiversity monitoring, poverty and human rights.

Outside of work I like to row with the [Zurich Penguins](https://zurichpenguins.ch/), do CrossFit and meditate.
