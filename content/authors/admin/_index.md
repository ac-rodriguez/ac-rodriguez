I am a PhD student at ETH Zurich working at the intersection of Remote Sensing, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I joined the EcoVision Lab in 2017 after finishing my master studies in Statistics at ETH Zurich.

Born and raised in Colombia, I developed a broader perception of global challenges like poverty, human rights and deforestation; which is why I actively direct my research towards solving them.

My current research interests are Machine Learning for Optical and Radar satellite imagery in large-scale applications, Fine-grained classification and Semi-supervised learning.
