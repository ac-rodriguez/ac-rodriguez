I am an **AI-specialist with over 6 years of experience** in developing cost-effective machine learning models for cost-effective and large-scale data applications.
After finishing my PhD at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Konrad Schinlder and Prof. Jan D. Wegner, I
**led [Kapok.ai](https://kapok.ai/) a tech startup for the past 1.5 years** overseeing strategic development and innovations in the agriculture and ESG sectors.
Collaborated with business partners on projects for  large-scale crop and environmental monitoring using satellite images.

My technical developments include: (1) a pioneering application of **generative models** in physics;
(2) highly accurate AI-models for image classification even when there is little to no training data samples; (3) an innovative technology for large-scale data analysis that reduces the labelling effort by 80\%.

Born and raised in Colombia, I developed a broader perception of global challenges like sustainable development, biodiversity monitoring, poverty and human rights.

Outside of work I like to row with the [Zurich Penguins](https://zurichpenguins.ch/), do CrossFit and meditate.
